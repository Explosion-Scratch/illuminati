        <p align="justify">He, who is searching for salvation, comes here! We 
          want to reconcile you with the world; we want to guide you to your felicitousness.</p>
        <p align="justify">We want to teach you the great art to feel enjoyment 
          with all objects in the world and all happenings in life. Those things 
          which are around you and which are the reason for your misfortune shall 
          lose their ugliness. The ugly shall be pleasant to you, the small shall 
          become the great, and the subject of your aversion shall turn into an 
          admirable object.</p>
        <p align="justify">Wisdom is the only way to joy, to salvation, to blessedness. 
          Come here! We want to teach you - wisdom.</p>
        <p align="justify">When you want to be a wise man then you shall know 
          that men call everything onto which their admiration and institution 
          are focused a purpose. Because there are existing endless purposes, 
          the same number as our wishes and desires and that they often contradict 
          themselves of that reason and that it is impossible to reach them all 
          at the same time; that consequently not all are good and legitimate; 
          that some could be higher, others could be lower, some could be tighter 
          and others just generality; that to determine the goodness and value 
          of the purpose, it must be a highest generality, therefore all the others, 
          the higher and the lower purposes are just behaving as a method or even 
          as a barricade; so then the confine purposes could stop being called 
          purposes; that the true wisdom of men shall carrying this last generality 
          and subordination itself; that our true wisdom and intellect have to 
          be considered of monitoring the purposes which were so important until 
          now, just to see as a method; and that consequently all pleasure and 
          displeasure, the higher be decreased and the lower be increased.</p>
        <p align="justify">Our point of view and our location are therefore the 
          source of our minor and major pleasure and contentment. To those reasons 
          are our salvation and blessedness bounded, with them it increases or 
          diminishes. No one as such a wise man alone could decide what in the 
          world is really big or small, what is just or unjust, good or evil, 
          ugly or beautiful, admirable or detestable. The one who can&#8217;t 
          understand the subordination of the purposes, whereby all become one 
          of the same purpose, his judgement is distorted, his admire foolish, 
          his creations vain and unstable, his intellect insecure and he is in 
          danger to fall into hands of misfortune evenly through that, that he 
          wants to avoid it. His saving method is his ruin and his believed ruin 
          is the method for saving him. As everybody else who never saw something 
          more beautiful and greater in his life, the one who recognizes the beauty 
          of his town as a Venus and the river which is floating through his neighbourhood 
          as the widest sea. In the same way our visible impression carries our 
          indolence in thinking for the judgement of the world and its parts, 
          our ignorance and our short view.</p>
        <p align="justify">This highest and best purpose alone is the station 
          onto which men go in order to overlook the world This station is the 
          one which is revolving your actual giants into dwarfs, the objects which 
          were disagreeable till now, representing in another, better property 
          and connexions, changing your perception and therefore your covetousness; 
          making the good to evil and the evil to good; taking off the ugly his 
          mask, multiplying the pleasure and this till now so busy world turning 
          into an Elysium.</p>
        <p align="justify">You have been looking throughout an allochromatic glass; 
          you have been snatching at soap-bubbles, you were thinking that the 
          hill, onto which the church of your village is standing, was the highest 
          mountain on earth, because it was your highest point of view; because 
          you stood at one unjustified place. Now rise here, onto the place here, 
          where We stand and look out anew into the world &#8211; and astonish! 
          A different, new, wonderful world! Your native country comes out as 
          a grain of sand, Europe as the hill of a mole. Our great, earth-shattering, 
          European affairs and businesses of mankind shrink down to the ant republic 
          and business; being almost lost in the monstrous chain of space, like 
          a drop of water in the world sea. See now your agony converting into 
          joy, the great into the small, imperceptible and your hell into a heaven. 
          This small, almost imperceptible one was it so, that made you care and 
          restlessness? Was it that, that took your complete soul? This small 
          one, and was it even the little ant-hill Europe, could move you to bring 
          discord among yours? To awake romp, anger and storm inside your soul; 
          and to withdraw heavenly cheerfulness? Miserable human, how little is 
          that what you are angry about! And how great, how eternal is that what 
          you treat unconcerned and carefree? &#8211; Climb so, if you can, higher 
          and higher upwards to us. This climbing upward, this generalization 
          of your point of view is the mountain or the great conductor to joy, 
          and on which the chosen one soars up already here to deity, to felicitousness, 
          because with every higher level, from the growing height, to uncover 
          an always more to him before unknown land of joy and happiness down 
          in the deep. This that seemed ugly, almost unbecoming from below, receives 
          just from this height its proper proportion and symmetry, and when then 
          in this upward and higher climbing finally the sun itself comes out 
          only as a spark, so then what should become of you, your wishes and 
          desires? O, then shame on you, of your proud, your imaginary highness 
          and greatness!</p>
        <p align="justify">But there below you were sitting already your whole 
          life and believed to be on summit. You have disgraced all that passed 
          by below, being too lazy to tear yourself and to raise. You have disgraced 
          us too, you miserable diminishing creature!</p>
        <p align="justify">That from here above, from the top of the tower where 
          you never venture to climb upward, we announce you a marvellous view 
          to a more beautiful land; calling us even morons and fanatics; laughing 
          about our simplicity and our Inexperience, that we are sitting in our 
          silent bed rooms besides our night lamps and selling hatched dreams 
          as truths to the world, and decreasing the misfortune and disaster of 
          men through an over stretched imagination. &#8211; Wake up from your 
          slumber, encourage yourself, raise up to us; or, if you don&#8217;t 
          want this, stop at least to disgrace the world. She is gods creation, 
          and who blames and blasphemes it, he blames and blasphemes his and your 
          creator. You don&#8217;t see the world of course as it is but only how 
          it can be seen from your point of view with by your desires colored 
          glass; and this standpoint is too lovely for you as that you would think 
          to leave it. Encourage yourself anyway and we will show you the land 
          where the ugly becomes the beauty and apparent disorder turns into regular 
          conformity.</p>
        <p align="justify"><br>
          - We want to show you that you, your family, your hometown, your home 
          country, even this earth, are only steps and periscopes through which 
          you are looking out into the world and the city of God. We will even 
          show you that you and your whole race are only following subordinated 
          methods of a higher purpose. That you, who you are so impertinent enough 
          to make yourself a purpose of the creation, that you, and the whole 
          human race as well, just being the lowest, not purpose, but nothing 
          else than a part of the inexhaustible rich nature. Like you and your 
          family are subordinated parts of the civil society.</p>
        <p align="justify"><br>
          Everything in the world is station, and the head and the heart of men 
          depend on this station, in delighting as also in suffering. The delight 
          lives above, in the higher regions, the suffer shrinks from there down 
          to the middle and lowest places. And because all is just a station, 
          it can be only the one the true one, from which you can overlook all 
          objects and at their true places. Not to far and not to close, not to 
          high and not to low, all this modifies our blessedness and opinions 
          so are out of us and take effect on us.</p>
        <p align="justify"><br>
          You little insignificant mite which I could annihilate - so you too 
          are one of my co-essences in the great conductor and gradation of nature? 
          Beings of my kind told me that you are little, weak and insignificant, 
          then you do not deliver and win battles, you besiege no cities and you 
          do not write little things in big folios; not understanding the art 
          to use hands of millions as a method for your own lust, to make your 
          neighbours small and to make yourself big on their costs, therefore 
          they, and me with them, called you little, weak and insignificant. I 
          should be therefore also just tool and method as you are? I, the king 
          of the nature, because of whom all is being! &#8211; But you wouldn&#8217;t 
          be here if you wouldn&#8217;t be that. We think that you are little 
          because we are comparing you to us; your figure ugly and your forces 
          restricted because they were not the our. But was I ever worm to know 
          what is happening in and with you? As you and all that is human and 
          not human, from this what happens inside the others, has no immediate 
          experience; who can&#8217;t imagine the forces and abilities which are 
          hiding in this or those configuration. This difference of your figure 
          to mine cause that this that happens inside you, not also happens same 
          time in men. But that therefore inside you maybe something better happens, 
          this has not been proved yet.</p>
        <p align="justify">Maybe it is preferable to be a mite, maybe it is degradation 
          being a human, if it could be possible that in this creation a stand 
          could humiliate.</p>
        <p align="justify"><br>
          Or from where the human being knows then that it is better as all left 
          as a residue beings? Because it knows itself better than all other? 
          So then what hinders others, in my eyes lower beings, to do a similar 
          end for their importance? Since when is the inability to think us into 
          the situation of others, an evidence of our advantage? Is then the one 
          generally constituted and proved truth that the people are the first 
          of all beings? Where are the evidences, that not only alone for us, 
          and not to prove also at the same time for other? - Enough that this 
          judgement flatters us, that it, where does not express the truth, nevertheless 
          our pride, our wishes and vanity: that the logic and philosophy of the 
          big pile, flattery and lies against our self, and built upon that and 
          contained of that conclusion. <br>
          - However, not so thinks the wise man. He who judges only truly and 
          correctly, determines the value of every thing, not after the relationship 
          which one has it onto foolish wishes, but according to the contribution 
          ability, according the assessment of the Universalmassa of the bliss 
          of all beings, for the manifestation of the size of his author: he finds, 
          that everything is, all is living signature and imprint of the deity. 
          We are it, you are it, and the least insect, and the smallest dust, 
          they also are it. Do not sin at that, don&#8217;t move anything of its 
          place; or destroy and move it after all; then, where you will put it 
          too it stands like this for all time at the place which the caution 
          and furnishings of the world assigned it.</p>
        <p align="justify"><br>
          However so far our lesson should not suffice today: this hour did not 
          come for you yet; let us descend rather again into low regions; staying 
          on the earth, and observing the walk of the world events. &#8211;</p>
