          Legend of the Sun God Tiki Viracocha</font></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Harrington">From the time before the Incas 
          reached to the domination in their kingdoms the Red Indians tell following 
          story:</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Harrington">&quot;Throughout a long period 
          of time mankind was not seeing the sun.<br>
          Many supplications and proclamations were pointed to the Gods, in which 
          they were implored to bring back the vanishing light. As it arose from 
          the Island of Titicaca, which is located in the Great Lake in the province 
          of Colla, the Sun in its quintessential magnificence, and all were full 
          of pleasure.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Harrington"><br>
          And then, so they said, a white man of great figure appeared whose lookout 
          and being called forth highest enchantment. <br>
          And this man had preternatural powers then he made mountains to plains 
          and plains to high mountains and he allowed fountains to arise from 
          the elevated rocks.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Harrington"><br>
          When they saw his power they called him &quot;Creator and Beginning 
          of all things&quot; and &quot;Father of the Sun&quot;. Except these 
          wonder acts, so it is delivered, he performed even greater, then he 
          evoked animals and men into existence. To say it in one word: out of 
          his hand were coming great benefactions. And this man took his way to 
          North and affected everywhere he was arriving the same miracles. But 
          then one didn't see him anymore.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Harrington">It says that he taught mankind 
          how to live and that he was gently and affectionately speaking with 
          them and ordering them to be good, not to inflict mischief and not to 
          endamage anybody but to love each other and to be merciful with Everyone. 
          Mostly they called him Tiki Viracocha, in the province Colla he is named 
          Tyapaca, in other parts of the country Arnauan </font></p>
