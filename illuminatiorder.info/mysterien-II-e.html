          It is difficult, to speak with people of subjects for which our languages 
          do not have any words yet; where our whole language is arranged onto 
          the opposite; where the impressions of the senses insure us from youth 
          incessantly the opposite, and upon that our abstract terms, intelligence, 
          logic and reason are built; where our whole cogitation system, even 
          our Inner Consciousness is basically shattered; where all our feelings, 
          thoughts, judgments, sciences, our first basic principles as doubtful, 
          to be supposed to appear as delusions, where it seems fury, the opposite 
          against a whole world, to maintain against his inner and external feeling. 
          However with this all We want to dare submitting our thoughts, and with 
          human being tongues to report things, that we hardly presume in the 
          distance through our highest reason to ourselves, but which we will 
          never develop in this figure completely and clearly; We want to see 
          who is strong enough to work itself out of this general delusion, at 
          making itself rid onto a time of the body and the senses, to transfigure 
          itself, and to think into another world.</p>
        <p align="justify">No human being has innate terms. We receive all our 
          terms first through the senses, in the measure as such better or worse, 
          several or fewer they are. These are at the beginning bare feelings. 
          General information and abstract terms arise first from repeated feelings; 
          are not anything as feelings of the similarities, can therefore without 
          preceding individual feelings, and consequently without preceding use 
          of the senses, not to be thought at all; onto that our whole intelligence 
          and reason are built than onto their only basis, or would one from birth 
          blind and deaf human being have presumably reason and sanity? Our this-time 
          terms of the world and their parts depend on these senses alone; with 
          other senses also our showings, feelings would change; if the building 
          of our eye would be microscopic: so we would be seen a new completely 
          other world, having another language and philosophy. </p>
        <p align="justify"><br>
          If We do not have any innate term now; all terms bare alone being negotiated 
          through the senses; these senses being capable of a humiliation and 
          increment, a decrease and increase: if in a still enclosed way the experience 
          shows that with every diversification or Modification along with their 
          parts the world appears to us differently; we consequently must achieve 
          with other senses of the world and their parts completely other ideas; 
          there with the alteration of the feelings also the abstract terms, all 
          that is based on that, after alteration of its basis must change: so 
          we have to maintain all cause with the greatest confidence, that this 
          earth so presumably, when all remaining part of the world that are not 
          what they appear to us at and before themselves; that with that all 
          our knowledge is built onto this varying Suppositum to all, however; 
          that everything these ours terms built onto that and not to lead abstractions 
          into the interior of the thing itself; that the indissoluble one of 
          most tasks striking there just comes of that; that therefore there are 
          philosophies so many and various, when different organized beings succeeded 
          for the reality; that the to us confessed five senses without ground 
          to be accepted as the single and last one from which one can imagine 
          the world. </p>
        <p align="justify"><br>
          If these conditions are correct, also everyone must let be liked so, 
          to accept following results as true, as undoubtedly even if on the other 
          hand also his whole interior should have outrage feeling, because they 
          are only direct ends and results from the preceding one, and the outrageous 
          internally feeling prove only, that to think this former kind too very 
          much with our nature, so to speak is joined onto the most intimate, 
          than that one could believe that current lecture should find many supporters 
          and confessors; it would be also ridiculous if people afterwards wanted 
          to talk and to act; when also the most eager confessor do not find such 
          necessary, and such lessons are bare for those which attend to the highest 
          considerations of the nature and their being which remember to jog to 
          at the borders of the human reason. It is only supposed to serve bare, 
          the pride and to humiliate impertinence of the human being,, to lead 
          back, onto the one that suits to them near, what is essential for their 
          felicitousness, to market the speculation spirit and to call for the 
          action, to show, what they do not know, also never will investigate, 
          to uncover the unrhymed one of the previous systems, to preserve to 
          human being in front of confused ways that materialism and his putative 
          thickness expose; to devise new grounds for the so strongly contested 
          one and our almost not to be proved perpetuity of our I, to represent 
          a so consolate, nearly entirely ridiculed lesson in a new aspect, and 
          to provide old, worn off things new charm and the glory of God and his 
          factories', to place in a new, unexpected, irrefutable way before eyes; 
          to prove, that the blown up human being, so proud of his reason, ridiculed 
          the inscrutable without cause, that perhaps impossibilities are possible.</p>
