        <p align="justify"><br>
          Once, as the primordial gleam exalted in purest dignity, willing to 
          kindle our perpetual glow of eternity; once, as inexplicable nonentity 
          turned into one inarticulate infinity; as the entire perfectibility 
          came out of simply singularity; yore, as a unique creation brought forth 
          this inexhaustible continuation; dominant disorder and a compulsory 
          confusion came forth to apply for their legitimate manifestation too. 
        </p>
        <p align="justify"> You and those who are as petite as you are, use to 
          imagine that the minute what you call life, is serving a significant, 
          crucial expression which you try to identify as a higher purpose, and 
          you believe to sense that your self-projected reality could tag along 
          this self-created imagination of your evaporate illusions and fugitive 
          visions; your escaping dreams and your dreamy desires; your absconding 
          admirations and your vanishing wishes. - But there were times before 
          your times; in eras before every era; in an age before all the ages, 
          when your complete sense; yes your absolute nous, awoke out of the one 
          single drop of an endless emptiness and divine beauty of an indecipherable 
          cosmic chaos. For apparently infinite epochs and multitudinous shining 
          periods there was no perceptible sagacity in the cosmic disorder of 
          the order till the day as a cosmic anarchy begun to orchestrate with 
          the supreme command, and inflamed the Big Bang of Spirit. - The true 
          spirit of men comes out of the unknown space of their heart. The true 
          heart of men is the nameless gizmo which crafts you wisdom and unlocks 
          your inner and outer truths of essence; your entrance key for stepping 
          light-hearted and happy-go-lucky through the worldly world. - The true 
          wisdom of your heart is the magic key to salvation and blessedness. 
          The tender brightness of your pure soul is the bright smile of the whole 
          world. All creations in heaven and on earth are a reversible reflect 
          of your own being. This being is on earth as in heaven.</p>
        <p align="justify">Feeling the infinite adore of its own generator, floating, 
          circulating and rotating through every sole fibre, every single breath 
          and every inconspicuous, unobtrusive cell of your insignificant, inconsequential 
          essence, is the utmost gift a human heart could ever endure. Serving 
          the kind will of this only initiator of all the existences, all beings 
          and all the essences, is the supreme gift a human soul may ever experience. 
          Seeking the whole world as a combination back to this contriver; exploring 
          and stepping through the unknown, tight and noisy jungle of the invincible, 
          visible phantom called certainty, while setting imagined orientation 
          points and self-created imaginations like close or far, white or black, 
          parable or difference; the soul is often anxious, fractious, manoeuvred 
          and insecure, Insecure of the possibilities which the never-ending creation 
          offers, presents and represents, which shine to be interesting and admirable, 
          inviting and tempting, pleasant and confident first, but at the end 
          to be only insensitive or excruciating, malicious or apathetic, malevolent 
          or indifferent.</p>
        <p align="justify"> The world which is around you, my friend, and whose 
          part you are, is wonderful and has what your soul admires the most; 
          its daily allurements and every bit of the nightly temptations, real 
          seductions and some unreal introductions but also what represents the 
          paramount in one sophisticated world; its responsibility, obligations 
          and consideration. - Your soul is searching back for the light which 
          is the seat of your soul.</p>
        <p align="justify"> - Enlightenment, my human child, is the most colossal 
          gift that a human spirit could ever receive, and it starts in the true 
          heart; the pure soul which found its true being through the incessant 
          fervour in its heart. But how an essence could ever be truly exempted 
          and purely sun-like shining without the spiritual orgasm inside its 
          core; without understanding the grace, the beauty and divine of its 
          originator through its vivid empathy?</p>
        <p align="center">Enlightened men have existed since mankind exists.</p>
        <p align="center"> Enlightened forces had existed before mankind exists.</p>
        <p align="center"> Enlightened hearts shall be one that in all mankind 
          exists.</p>
        <p align="center"><br>
          - Noli turbare circulos meos!</p>
        <p align="justify"> This is just our very own way to glide through the 
          spiritual worlds. You are not one of us nor are you desired to ever 
          become one of us. - There is no moment signed in time in which somebody 
          could join the light of the primal ember; but time decides if there 
          will be a need for a new lightning of the luminosity; this incident 
          which happens only once in your lifetime is the rebirth of your spirit 
          and it starts with self recognition. The rebirth into the circle of 
          light is irreversible.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is obvious and beyond a shadow of a doubt an obligation 
          for my brother to possess an academic degree; but if you think you should 
          accomplish your academic degree only to be proficient to cross the threshold, 
          you&#8217;re not one of us. To be a freemason is not a necessity for 
          my brother but almost all honourable members of our venerable Order 
          are also honourable members of their local venerated Masonic lodge. 
          The majority of my honourable Masonic brethren don&#8217;t even know 
          that we exist and they don&#8217;t hold any kind of connection to any 
          of our honoured fraternities at all. Those are two ways which have been 
          opened to the elements by the One. There are myriads of masons worldwide 
          but only a very few are of our kind. - Our souls are a myriad of wars, 
          battles and fights but also the place where the creator meets his creation.</p>
        <p align="justify"> As an honourable Knight of Kadosh, a mason of 32nd 
          degree in Scottish Rites or honourable Knights Templar of the Commandery 
          Order of York Rites, my brother is competent to enter the pyramid at 
          the 3rd echelon.</p>
